# Backend Project

This repository contains the backend code for a project built as part of a tutorial by [Devtiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iJ0NWRaWic). The focus of the tutorial was to develop a backend using Kotlin and Spring Boot, emphasizing concepts such as REST APIs, data persistence, and testing.

## Features

- Domain modeling with Kotlin.
- REST API endpoints for CRUD operations on authors and books.
- Integration with a relational database using Spring Data JPA.
- Database migrations with Flyway.
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- Handling data relationships, including cascading operations.

## Context

This backend was developed as a learning project. While following Devtiro's tutorial, I implemented and adapted the concepts covered to understand backend development in Kotlin more thoroughly.
